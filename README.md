Ability to change the tip percentage. Rounding off the tip is preffered (this is my personal way of writing a tip because it’s easy to copy & write it on the bill)

✔︎ Tip choices: 18%, 20%, 22%  
✔︎ Tip value should be updated when tip is changed  
✔ iOS Picker View is the preffered input method for choosing tip percentage
